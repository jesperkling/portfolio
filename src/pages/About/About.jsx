          <h3>I'm a developer based in Malm√∂, Sweden</h3>
          <p>
            I have a diverse background in logistics and customs. I always had
            an interest and passion for learning more about technology. That's
            why I 2021 decided to study to become a Frontend Developer to have
            the possibility to combine two passions of mine technology and
            design.
